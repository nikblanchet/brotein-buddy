## Overview

This document explains the design and implementation of the box priority selection algorithm in BroteinBuddy. This algorithm determines which box should be used when multiple boxes of the same flavor exist, implementing a multi-criteria priority system to ensure optimal inventory rotation.

## Problem Statement

When a user wants to consume a protein shake of a specific flavor, and multiple boxes of that flavor exist in inventory, the system needs to automatically select the "best" box to use. The selection criteria should:

1. **Minimize waste**: Use boxes that are already open before opening new ones
2. **Clear inventory efficiently**: Finish boxes that are nearly empty before starting fuller ones
3. **Optimize accessibility**: Prefer boxes that are easier to reach (higher on stack)

This creates a multi-criteria sorting problem that requires careful design to ensure predictable, testable behavior.

## Design Approach

### Multi-Criteria Priority System

The algorithm uses a three-level priority hierarchy:

```
Priority 1: Open Status (open before unopened)
    └─> Priority 2: Quantity (lower before higher)
        └─> Priority 3: Stack Height (higher before lower)
```

This hierarchy means:

- An open box with 10 bottles will be selected over an unopened box with 1 bottle
- Among open boxes, one with 3 bottles will be selected over one with 8 bottles
- Among open boxes with the same quantity, one at height 5 will be selected over one at height 2

### Algorithm Implementation

The implementation follows a filter-and-sort pattern:

```typescript
export function selectPriorityBox(boxes: Box[], flavorId: string): Box | null {
  // 1. Filter: Get only boxes matching the flavor
  const matchingBoxes = boxes.filter((box) => box.flavorId === flavorId);

  // 2. Guard: Return null if no matches
  if (matchingBoxes.length === 0) {
    return null;
  }

  // 3. Sort: Apply multi-criteria priority rules
  const sortedBoxes = matchingBoxes.sort((a, b) => {
    // Rule 1: Open boxes before unopened
    if (a.isOpen !== b.isOpen) {
      return (b.isOpen ? 1 : 0) - (a.isOpen ? 1 : 0);
    }

    // Rule 2: Lower quantity before higher
    if (a.quantity !== b.quantity) {
      return a.quantity - b.quantity;
    }

    // Rule 3: Higher stack position before lower
    return b.location.height - a.location.height;
  });

  // 4. Select: Return the highest priority box
  return sortedBoxes[0];
}
```

### Design Decisions

**Why this priority order?**

1. **Open status first**: Prevents waste. Once a box is open, its shelf life decreases. Using open boxes first ensures they don't spoil before being consumed.

2. **Quantity second**: Promotes efficient inventory rotation. Finishing nearly-empty boxes frees up storage space and provides a sense of progress.

3. **Height third**: Improves user experience. Boxes higher on a stack are typically more accessible (assuming stacks are built from the ground up). This is a minor convenience but provides consistent behavior.

**Why not consider stack number?**

The horizontal position (stack number) doesn't affect priority because:

- All stacks are assumed to be equally accessible
- Stack number is arbitrary and doesn't indicate any inherent priority
- Simpler algorithm with fewer criteria is easier to test and maintain

**Why stable sort behavior?**

When all priority criteria are equal, the algorithm returns the first box in the filtered array. This provides:

- Deterministic behavior (same input always produces same output)
- Predictable testing (tests can rely on array order)
- Simpler implementation (no need for additional tiebreakers)

## Testing Strategy

### Test-Driven Development

This algorithm was developed using TDD principles:

1. **Write tests first**: Define expected behavior through test cases
2. **Implement to pass**: Write minimal code to make tests pass
3. **Refactor**: Clean up implementation while keeping tests green

### Test Coverage Structure

The test suite is organized into logical groups:

```typescript
describe('selectPriorityBox', () => {
  describe('basic functionality', () => {
    // Edge cases: empty arrays, no matches, single box
  });

  describe('priority rule 1: open before unopened', () => {
    // Test open status priority under various conditions
  });

  describe('priority rule 2: lower quantity before higher', () => {
    // Test quantity priority among same open status
  });

  describe('priority rule 3: higher stack position before lower', () => {
    // Test height priority when other factors equal
  });

  describe('combined priority rules', () => {
    // Test interactions between multiple rules
  });

  describe('edge cases', () => {
    // Large datasets, identical boxes, multiple flavors
  });
});
```

### Critical Test Cases

**Basic Functionality**

```typescript
// Single box - should return that box
selectPriorityBox([chocolateBox], 'chocolate') → chocolateBox

// No matches - should return null
selectPriorityBox([vanillaBox], 'chocolate') → null

// Empty array - should return null
selectPriorityBox([], 'chocolate') → null
```

**Priority Rule 1: Open Status**

```typescript
// Open box beats unopened, regardless of quantity
boxes = [
  { flavorId: 'chocolate', quantity: 3, isOpen: false },
  { flavorId: 'chocolate', quantity: 10, isOpen: true }
]
selectPriorityBox(boxes, 'chocolate') → box with isOpen: true
```

**Priority Rule 2: Quantity**

```typescript
// Lower quantity beats higher, when open status is equal
boxes = [
  { flavorId: 'chocolate', quantity: 10, isOpen: true },
  { flavorId: 'chocolate', quantity: 3, isOpen: true }
]
selectPriorityBox(boxes, 'chocolate') → box with quantity: 3
```

**Priority Rule 3: Height**

```typescript
// Higher height beats lower, when open status and quantity are equal
boxes = [
  { flavorId: 'chocolate', quantity: 6, height: 0, isOpen: true },
  { flavorId: 'chocolate', quantity: 6, height: 3, isOpen: true }
]
selectPriorityBox(boxes, 'chocolate') → box with height: 3
```

**Combined Rules**

```typescript
// All three rules working together
boxes = [
  { flavorId: 'chocolate', quantity: 12, height: 5, isOpen: false },
  { flavorId: 'chocolate', quantity: 8, height: 0, isOpen: true },
  { flavorId: 'chocolate', quantity: 3, height: 2, isOpen: true }
]
// Should select: open (rule 1), lowest quantity (rule 2)
selectPriorityBox(boxes, 'chocolate') → box with quantity: 3, isOpen: true
```

### Coverage Metrics

The test suite achieves 100% coverage:

- **21 test cases** covering all code paths
- **Statements**: 100%
- **Branches**: 100%
- **Functions**: 100%
- **Lines**: 100%

This meets BroteinBuddy's requirement for 100% coverage on critical path logic.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

- **Filter operation**: O(n) where n is the total number of boxes
- **Sort operation**: O(m log m) where m is the number of matching boxes
- **Overall**: O(n + m log m)

For typical use cases (< 100 boxes, < 20 of any single flavor), performance is negligible.

### Space Complexity

- **Filter result**: O(m) for the filtered array
- **Sort**: O(m) for the sorted array
- **Overall**: O(m)

The algorithm creates a new filtered array and a new sorted array, both proportional to the number of matching boxes.

### Optimization Considerations

**Could we optimize further?**

Yes, but it's not worth it:

1. We could use a single pass with manual tracking instead of filter + sort
2. We could use a min-heap to avoid full sort

However:

- Current implementation is O(n log n) which is fast enough for expected data sizes
- Code clarity is more valuable than micro-optimizations
- Premature optimization would make the code harder to understand and test

**Quote from Donald Knuth:**

> "Premature optimization is the root of all evil (or at least most of it) in programming."

For this algorithm, readability and testability are more important than theoretical performance gains.

## Edge Cases and Robustness

### Handled Edge Cases

1. **Empty input**: Returns null gracefully
2. **No matching flavor**: Returns null (filtered array is empty)
3. **Single matching box**: Returns that box without sorting
4. **All criteria equal**: Uses stable sort (returns first in array)
5. **Large datasets**: Tested with 100 boxes
6. **Multiple flavors**: Correctly filters to requested flavor only
7. **Zero quantity boxes**: Treated as valid, prioritized highest (lowest quantity)

### Type Safety

TypeScript provides compile-time guarantees:

```typescript
// Input types
boxes: Box[]        // Must be array of valid Box objects
flavorId: string    // Must be string

// Return type
Box | null          // Either a Box or null (no undefined, no other types)
```

The `Box` type includes runtime validation through type guards (from deliverable 1.1), ensuring data integrity.

## Integration with BroteinBuddy

### Current Use

This algorithm is used in:

- **Phase 2.3**: Random flavor selection (selecting which box of the randomly chosen flavor)
- **Phase 2.5**: Manual flavor selection (same use case)
- **Phase 2.2**: Favorite flavor quick-pick (same use case)

### Future Enhancements

Potential extensions (not in current scope):

1. **Alternative box suggestions**: Return all matching boxes sorted by priority
2. **User preferences**: Allow users to customize priority rules
3. **Location-aware sorting**: Consider physical proximity to user's location
4. **Expiration date priority**: If boxes track expiration dates, prioritize older ones

These would require:

- API changes (different function signature)
- Additional data model fields
- New test cases
- Updated documentation

## Key Takeaways

### Algorithm Design Principles

1. **Clear requirements lead to clear code**: Well-defined priority rules made implementation straightforward

2. **Multi-criteria sorting**: Use hierarchical comparisons in a single sort function rather than multiple passes

3. **Filter then sort**: Reduce the working set before applying expensive operations

4. **Fail fast with guards**: Early return for edge cases improves readability

### Testing Best Practices

1. **Organize tests logically**: Group by feature/rule being tested, not by implementation detail

2. **Test one thing per test**: Each test validates a single behavior or edge case

3. **Use descriptive names**: Test names should explain what is being tested and the expected outcome

4. **Cover combinations**: Test not just individual rules, but their interactions

5. **Include edge cases**: Empty arrays, single elements, large datasets, identical values

### Code Quality

1. **Documentation is code**: Comprehensive JSDoc with examples serves as both documentation and specification

2. **Type safety catches bugs**: TypeScript's type system prevents many runtime errors

3. **100% coverage for critical paths**: This algorithm is critical business logic and deserves full test coverage

4. **Readability over cleverness**: Clear, straightforward code is more valuable than clever optimizations

## Conclusion

The box priority selection algorithm demonstrates that even simple sorting problems benefit from:

- Clear design with explicit priority rules
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Thoughtful documentation
- Type safety

This approach creates code that is:

- Correct (proven by tests)
- Maintainable (clear logic and structure)
- Robust (handles edge cases)
- Performant (efficient enough for the use case)

These principles apply to algorithm design in general, whether building a simple selection function or a complex system.
