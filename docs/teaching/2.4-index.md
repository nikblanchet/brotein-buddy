## Key Takeaways by Document

### Main Implementation Guide

1. **SessionStorage for workflow state** - Perfect for temporary multi-screen flows
2. **Automatic actions on mount** - Make the happy path effortless
3. **Progressive error diagnosis** - Specific, actionable error messages
4. **Accessibility built in** - ARIA attributes from the start
5. **Three-layer state architecture** - Stores, sessionStorage, component state

### Code Review Process

1. **Good code can always get better** - 9.5/10 → 9.5/10 (different reasons)
2. **Extract reusable utilities early** - Prevent duplication and drift
3. **Optimize pragmatically** - Test systematically to find optimal values
4. **Error messages are UX** - Specific and actionable beats generic
5. **Small improvements compound** - 40 minutes of refinement = huge impact

### Svelte 5 Patterns

1. **Explicit over implicit** - `$state` is clearer than magic reactivity
2. **Derive what you can, store what you must** - Minimize state
3. **Three layers of state** - Each layer serves its purpose
4. **Effects for side effects only** - Not for computing values
5. **Defensive programming** - Check for null, provide helpful errors

## Common Questions Answered

### Q: Why sessionStorage instead of a Svelte store?

**Answer:** SessionStorage survives navigation (necessary for multi-screen flows) but clears when the tab closes (desired for temporary workflows). Stores would persist in localStorage, which isn't appropriate for workflow state. See **Main Implementation Guide, section "The Big Picture"**.

### Q: Why the 10ms delay on mount?

**Answer:** There's a race condition: the store might not be fully hydrated from localStorage when the component mounts. We tested 0ms (flaky), 5ms (tight), 10ms (reliable), and 150ms (unnecessarily slow). 10ms is the minimum reliable delay. See **Code Review Process, Improvement #2**.

### Q: How does the box priority system work?

**Answer:** Three-tier priority: (1) Open before unopened, (2) Lower quantity before higher, (3) Higher stack position before lower. Implemented as a comparator function that can be reused. See **Main Implementation Guide, section "The Box Priority System"**.

### Q: What's the difference between `$state` and `$derived`?

**Answer:** `$state` is for values that change independently. `$derived` is for values computed from other reactive values. If it's computed, use `$derived`. If it's independent, use `$state`. See **Svelte 5 Patterns, Rune #1 and #2**.

### Q: How do you test statistical distributions?

**Answer:** Run the random selection 1000 times, count how often each flavor is selected, compare to expected probabilities with a tolerance (±10%). See **Main Implementation Guide** and `tests/unit/random-selection.test.ts`.

### Q: What makes a good error message?

**Answer:** (1) Specific about what's wrong ("All 3 boxes are empty"), (2) Proper pluralization ("1 flavor is" vs "2 flavors are"), (3) Actionable guidance ("Go to Inventory Management and tap 'New Flavor'"). See **Code Review Process, Improvement #3**.
