# Integration Tests

Note: Integration tests for Svelte 5 components with @testing-library/svelte are currently disabled due to a compatibility issue between @testing-library/svelte v5.2.8 and Svelte 5's runes.

This will be addressed in a future update once the library adds full Svelte 5 support.

For now, we rely on:
- Unit tests for logic
- E2E tests for component behavior
